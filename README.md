# p5js
[p5js](https://p5js.org/) '&hellip;is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.'

Included are some projects developed to learn more about [p5js](https://p5js.org/). My first efforts were inspired by [Meredith Strickland](https://medium.com/@mere.strickland/create-your-own-sol-lewitt-with-p5-js-165cdeda2d88) and a recent visit to [Mass MoCA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tp3ox1XT4pzBiW37A). Enjoy!
