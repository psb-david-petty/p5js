# README.md

I learned a lot about [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/) doing these projects.

## What I learned&hellip;

- p5.js is excellent for webpages w/ (responsive) graphics embedded.
- The MDN ([Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/)) is the best source of Javascript documentation.

## Testing `README.md`

This was originally a test to see whether `README.html` or `index.html` takes precedence on [Github Pages](https://psb-david-petty.github.io/p5js/2023-2024-bhs-schedule/).

Actually, this [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48919506) answer clarifies: `index.html` takes precedence. *In addition*, it looks like [`README.html`](https://psb-david-petty.github.io/p5js/2023-2024-bhs-schedule/README.html) as the default is not even created from `README.md` unless there is no `index.html`.
